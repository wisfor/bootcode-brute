# Bootcode Brute
Bootcode Brute allows you to bruteforce your Android phone's bootloader unlock code if you have no other option of obtaining the unlock code (or you just don't want to pay :P)

## How to use this?
Simply start the script, enter your IMEI number, select your phone, grab a coffee (or two) and wait.
If your phone does not reboot back to Android after a few attempts, edit the script and set the `autoreboot` variable to False to speed up the overall process.
